# Royal Spinner

Did you know that Burger King (ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´) is currently giving out free coupons and meals? Simply go to [burgerking.no/royalspin](https://burgerking.no/royalspin) and make and account to get a shot at your free rewards. Alternatively you could automate the campaign and register accounts on mass to increase your odds of getting rewards, if the latter sounds more attractive you should continue reading.

> [!WARNING]  
> The campaign is ending on **16/12/2024**

## Prerequisites
You will need a Capsolver API key to automate the captchas and a ton of emails (easiest is using **catch-all** addresses)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Edit `main.py` and replace `YOUR_KEY` with a credited **CAPSOLVER** API key
3. Fill `emails.txt` with emails
4. Optional: Put proxies into `proxies.txt`
5. Run main.py
6. Check your inbox(es) for rewards

## Improvements?
This is just a simple PoC of automating their campaign and could easily be improved through concurrency. If you have any changes/improvements for the code, please feel free to open a PR.
