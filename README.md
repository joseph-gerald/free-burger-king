# Royal Spinner
### How their campaign works
Burger King Norway's current campaign has users registering accounts to spin a slot in hopes of earning rewards ranging from coupons to completely free meals. This campaign is very easy for anyone to abuse, with the only possible difficulties of scaling being the captcha (ReCaptcha) and emails, which can be circumvented by captcha solving solutions and catch-all addresses.

> [!WARNING]  
> The campaign is ending on **16/12/2024**

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Edit `main.py` and replace `YOUR_KEY` with a credited **CAPSOLVER** API key
3. Fill `emails.txt` with emails (easiest is using **catch-all** addresses)
4. Optional: Put proxies into `proxies.txt`
5. Run main.py
6. Check your inbox(es) for rewards

## Improvements?
This is just a simple PoC of automating their campaign and could easily be improved through concurrency. If you have any changes/improvements for the code, please feel free to open a PR.
